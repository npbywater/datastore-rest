## Rules for IRMA/DataStore Reference types

Rules for Reference types: **PROGRAM**, **PROJECT**, and **PRODUCT**.

**NOTE:** A 'PRODUCT' is not an actual Reference Type, but, rather, is
a catch-all term for Reference "products" such as "Journal Article" or
"Tabular Dataset".

1. A **PROGRAM** Reference has children (project references), but not
   projects or products.

2. A **PROJECT** Reference does not have children, but it does have
   product references.

3. A **PRODUCT** Reference does not have children or products. But it
   may belong to a project with related sibling products. That is, it
   may "have" a node with a reference to a project and its sibling
   products.
